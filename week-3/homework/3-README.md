## Assignment 3: C++ Program with Array and Process Management

### Task:
Write a C++ program that creates an array of 20 elements. Fill the array elements using a random number generator. 

- Create a **child process** that finds the minimum number in the **second half** of the array.
- The **parent process** will find the minimum number in the **first half** of the array.
- Display the minimum numbers found in each process, along with their process IDs.
- Finally, display the minimum number of the entire array.

### Requirements:
- Use random number generation to fill the array.
- Fork a child process to handle half of the array.
- Find and display the minimum numbers from each half, along with the process IDs.
- Display the overall minimum number of the array.
